# CMPSC-461

## This repository contains my work for CMPSC 461 at Penn State. In this course, I learned about various programming concepts and theories, including:

- Functional Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures
- Algorithms

Throughout the course, I gained a solid understanding of these programming paradigms and their applications. This README serves as a documentation of my progress and the projects I completed during the course.

Feel free to explore the repository and learn more about the theory of programming!
